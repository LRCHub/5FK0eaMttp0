[00:16.23] Well, she was fighting for something steady
[00:19.74] And I was fighting her all fours and ready for
[00:23.01] Anything that felt too heavy
[00:25.69] Got damn good at leading her on
[00:41.19] 
[00:29.04] But now she's gone
[00:31.50] I let her go without a second thought
[00:34.33] Now I'm the only one that can't move on
[00:38.78] Still wanting it, still I'm wondering
[00:57.28] 
[00:41.51] If I would have chased her, would have just tried
[00:44.76] Wouldn't have felt the sting of her goodbye
[00:48.26] If I would've set aside a little more time and a lot more pride
[00:52.77] Would she still be mine?
[01:04.77] 
[00:54.82] I should've known better
[00:55.95] Should've made the last call over the phone better
[00:59.53] Should've been a little bit more of a go-getter
[01:02.73] Would've saved myself from a whole lot of hurt
[01:06.84] If I would've chased her
[01:18.84] 
[01:14.11] I wouldn't be kickin' myself
[01:17.41] 'Cause we'd be busy kickin' dust on a dirt road wherever the wind blows
[01:22.01] Instead I'm in Hell
[01:24.13] Watching her run, and run, and run, and run
[01:45.63] 
[01:28.23] 'Cause now she's gone
[01:30.30] I let her go without a second thought
[01:33.48] Now I'm the only one that can't move on
[01:37.88] Still wanting it, still wondering
[01:54.38] 
[01:40.75] If I would have chased her, would have just tried
[01:43.60] Wouldn't have felt the sting of her goodbye
[01:46.94] If I would've set aside a little more time and a lot more pride
[01:51.94] Would she still be mine?
[02:03.94] 
[01:53.76] I should've known better
[01:55.89] Should've made the last call over the phone better
[01:58.78] Should've been a little bit more of a go-getter
[02:02.21] Would've saved myself from a whole lot of hurt
[02:06.60] If I would've chased her
[02:18.60] 
[02:09.96] Ooh-no-no
[02:12.84] If I would've chased her, yeah-yeah
[02:30.34] 
[02:20.39] I should've known better now I'm all alone
[02:23.39] Sipping something to forget her
[02:25.34] Knowing that it's probably gonna take me forever
[02:28.60] 'Til then I'll still be wanting it, still wondering
[02:54.10] 
[02:33.46] If I would have chased her, would have just tried
[02:36.80] Wouldn't have felt the sting of her goodbye
[02:40.08] If I would've set aside a little more time and a lot more pride
[02:44.59] Would she still be mine?
[02:56.59] 
[02:46.95] I should've known better
[02:48.40] Should've made the last call over the phone better
[02:51.72] Should've been a little bit more of a go-getter
[02:55.09] Would've saved myself from a whole lot of hurt
[02:58.91] If I would've chased her
[03:10.91] 
[03:02.72] Ooh-no
[03:05.50] If I would've chased her, yeah-yeah
[03:12.33] If I would've chased her
